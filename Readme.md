This projects focuses on the resolving issues related to mental 
healthcare and also divides the fine line between psychiatrists and psychologists. People 
fail to understand the difference between the two and this website aims to provide the 
services as well as educate people about the importance of mental health in our day to 
day lives. The system has a web login for both the doctors as well as the patients and 
works for the betterment and advancement of both of them. Each patient can select their 
own psychiatrists and/or psychologists based on the specialist type they want or they 
have an option to take a test and the website automatically gives a list of doctors for the 
problem predicted from the test results and can also interact with them using the chat 
messenger in the portal. The chat services can be free or at a minimal cost as decided 
by the registered personnel.
